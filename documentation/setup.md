### SnakeAI
The snake project - [SnakeAI](https://github.com/greerviau/SnakeAI) however is run on Processing, which I think is a Java based, scripting language for drawing?

that can possibly not be compatible with what we're doing.

uses `.pde` files or sumn lmfao.


### self driving car
[Neural_Network_NEAT](https://github.com/Hilicot/Neural_Network_NEAT)
this one is completely python and even has a game on it.

had to install these packages
```
neat-python 0.92
numpy       1.22.3
pip         22.0.4
pygame      2.1.2
scipy       1.8.0
setuptools  61.2.0
wheel       0.37.1
```

also `pypi` is kinda wonky to use.
